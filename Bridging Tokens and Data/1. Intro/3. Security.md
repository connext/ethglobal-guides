# Security

At Connext we take security very seriously. We understand that an interoperability protocol must be as safe as possible agains a number of different attack vectors. Let's break this down:

## Types of security
- Economic -> "How much does it cost to corrupt your system"
- Implementation -> "How complex is your system to implement? what does your team security hygiene look like?"
- Environmental -> "Can your bridge withstand attacks on underlying domains?"

# Economic security at Connext
- Connext uses either the AMB or optimistic bridges to pass messages around. To break these, you must bribe all watchers of the system, or all underlying domain validators

# Implementation security at Connext
- We follow a strict audit process for all code that goes on mainnet
- We believe in graduated security, with gradual launches to derisk protocols over time (talk about liquidity caps, watchers being able to pause and disconnect chains from the network, pausability)

# Environmental security at Connext
- Because we are able to disconnect messages from specific domains, we can maintain the security of high information integrity zones (Ethereum; not susceptible to 51% attacks) while supporting zones with growing information integrity security (new domains; smaller validator set; more susceptible to 51% attacks)
- watchers help us maintain the security of ^^
